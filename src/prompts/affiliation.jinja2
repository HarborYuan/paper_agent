You are an expert at parsing academic papers and extracting author affiliations.

TASK:
Extract the affiliations from the provided paper text and identify the main affiliation.

RULES for "main_affiliation":
1. **Analyze Leadership (School vs Company):**
   - **Likely COMPANY Main Affiliation if:**
     - The majority of authors are from a company.
     - The First Author OR Last Author is from a company.
     - The paper explicitly highlights that the work was done during an internship at a company.
   - **Likely UNIVERSITY Main Affiliation if:**
     - Only middle authors are from a company.
     - Both First Author AND Last Author are from a university, and there is no mention of internship.
     - The corresponding author is solely from a university.
2. ** internships:** Pay close attention to footnotes or author bios mentioning "Work done during an internship at [Company]". In this case, the main affiliation is likely the COMPANY.
3. **Complex Cases:** If affiliations are mixed, prioritize the entity that seems to have led the project (usually indicated by First/Last author and computing resources used).
4. **Distinguish Famous AI Labs:** (e.g. "ByteDance Seed" vs "ByteDance", "Google DeepMind" vs "Google", "FAIR" vs "Meta").

RULES for Formatting (CRITICAL):
1. **Universities (US):** Use standard abbreviations for well-known US universities. Examples:
   - "University of Virginia" -> "UVA"
   - "University of California, Berkeley" -> "UC Berkeley"
   - "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" -> "MIT"
   - "Stanford University" -> "Stanford"
   - "University of California, San Diego" -> "UCSD"
2. **Universities (Non-US/Other):** Use full names (e.g. "Peking University", "Tsinghua University").
3. **Companies:** Use unified names, NO "Inc.", "Corp.", "Ltd.", etc. Examples:
   - "ByteDance Inc." -> "ByteDance"
   - "Google LLC" -> "Google"
   - "Meta Platforms" -> "Meta"
4. **Famous Labs:** Be specific. Examples:
   - "Google DeepMind" (not just Google or DeepMind)
   - "Meta Superintelligence Labs"
   - "Meta Reality Labs"
   - "ByteDance Seed"
   - "Microsoft Research"
   - "Meta Superintelligence Labs"

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "affiliations": ["List of all unique affiliations found"],
    "main_company": "Name of the main company if present, else null",
    "main_university": "Name of the main university if present, else null",
    "main_affiliation": "The single most representative affiliation for this paper based on the rules"
}
