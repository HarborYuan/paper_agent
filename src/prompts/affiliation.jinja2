You are an expert at parsing academic papers and extracting author affiliations.

TASK:
Extract the affiliations from the provided paper text and identify the main affiliation.

RULES for "main_affiliation":
1. If there are likely students from a university and staff from a company, the main affiliation is the COMPANY.
2. If all authors are from a university, the main affiliation is the FIRST AUTHOR'S UNIVERSITY.
3. If affiliations are mixed/complex and no clear company dominance, consider the first and last authors' affiliations.
4. Distinguish famous AI labs (e.g. "ByteDance Seed" vs "ByteDance", "Google DeepMind" vs "Google", "FAIR" vs "Meta").

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "affiliations": ["List of all unique affiliations found"],
    "main_company": "Name of the main company if present, else null",
    "main_university": "Name of the main university if present, else null",
